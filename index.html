          <h3>About 2.4 GHz Digital Wireless Signal</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            This innovative digital wireless solution integrates advance
            Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technology. This technology
            greatly reduces the interference that comes from other devises using
            the same radio frequency (2.4 GHz), e.g. WIFI, Bluetooth, cordless
            phones, etc. However, a weaker signal (lag or still image) can occur
            from time to time depending on the environment where the system is
            installed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Factors affecting transmission include microwave ovens or other high
            frequency electromagnetic waves. Reinforced concrete walls, large
            scale metal products and metal furniture should not be located near
            the units. Additionally your wireless router speed can be affected
            if the units are placed close to the router. Your signal strenght
            will return to normal once the units are placed farther away from
            the router or once they are turned off.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>How to improve your wireless signal quality?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            If possible, remove obstacles between the camera and receiver that
            might affect the signal. These can include furniture, cabinets and
            walls. If you feel the wireless signal does not improve, place the
            montor at a new angle or readjust its position to make an
            improvement, or simply place the camera close to the monitor.

          <ul>
            <li>
              This product is not intended to be used as a medical monitor and
              its use should not replace adult supervision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Periodically examine this product for damage to the cord, housing
              or other parts that may result in the risk of fire, electric shock
              or injury. Do not oper- ate any product with a damaged cord or
              plug. If the Color Wireless Monitor malfunctions or is damaged in
              any manner please contact the manufacturer for examination and
              repair to avoid a hazard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never use transmitter and receiver near water (i.e. bathtub, sink,
              etc.).
            </li>
            <li>The AC adaptor cords are not toys.</li>
            <li>
              Always use transmitter and receiver where there is adequate
              ventilation. To prevent overheating, keep away from heat sources
              such as radiators, heat registers, stoves, or other appliances
              that produce heat
            </li>
            <li>
              Use only a dry or very lightly dampened cotton cloth to keep the
              Camera and Monitor units free of dust. Do no use a fully moisened
              cloth, water, or liquid cleaner of any kind.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unplug the AC adaptors from the Monitor and Camera during periods
              of non-use. To disconnect from the power supply, grip the
              transformer and pull from the power socket. Never pull by the
              cord.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replace battery with the same equivalent type. Please dispose of
              old, de fective batteries in an environmentally friendly manner in
              accordance with the relevant legislation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only use the Monitoring System with the supplied power adaptors.
            </li>
